# CytokineStorm

- To run the model, and generate all figures in "Cytokine storm mitigation for exogenous immune agonists", run tumor_CART_Github.m
- To run the local sensitivity analysis and generate Figure 5 in the paper, run local_sensivivity_T_Ymax_final.m
- Note that both codes have the MATLAB functions encoded at the bottom of the main script file. If your version of MATLAB does not support this, please remove the function files and save each one separately in its own .m file.
